Image Encryption Project

Overview --
The Image Encryption Project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload images, encrypt them using cryptographic algorithms, and then decrypt the images with a key. The project demonstrates how to handle file uploads, encryption, and decryption using Python's Flask and Cryptography libraries.

Features --
Upload images through a simple web interface.
Encrypt the uploaded image.
The Encryption Process generate - (a) Image Address (b) Key.
Decrypt the encrypted image by providing the correct key.
After then Decrypted image is downloaded in your system.
Simple and intuitive web-based user interface.

Technologies Used --
Flask (v2.1.1): A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python used to build the backend and handle routing.
Cryptography (v39.0.0): A Python library that provides cryptographic recipes and primitives to encrypt and decrypt image data.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies to create the user interface for uploading and downloading images.
